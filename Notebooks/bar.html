The Rutgers University Central American Geochemical data (RU_CAGeochem) includes the active volcanoes related to the Cocos-Caribbean convergent plate boundary that extends from Guatemala to Costa Rica in Central America. The RU prefix signifies that the data and/or samples are primarily from the long-term Central American research project started at Dartmouth College in 1970 and continued at Rutgers University between 1974 to the present. The database is decidedly uneven because of the impressive improvement of analytical techniques during the period of sample and data production. Further complications arise because most of the sampling and analysis were part of the educational process for many different undergraduate and graduate students using different types of instruments. This note presents, as a reasonably coherent whole, geochemical data and metadata for about 1325 samples collected by at least 40 students and colleagues. Many new Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios are included here but most of the new data are metadata that provide greatly improved descriptions of the locations and status of the samples as well as estimates of data quality.","***There is a newer version of this file that updates the Primary Method Metadata tab.*** Major element compositions of glass from lava samples from Axial Seamount, Juan de Fuca Ridge, determined by electron microprobe.

Either or both of these modes of paleoclimate variability may have influenced East African mammalian evolution, yet the interrelationship between these secular and orbital paleoclimate signals remains poorly understood.  Here, we explore whether the long-term secular climate change was accompanied by significant changes at the orbital-scale as well. We develop Northeast African hydroclimate and vegetation proxy data for two 100 kyr-duration windows near 3.05 Ma and 1.75 Ma at ODP Site 967 in the eastern Mediterranean basin where sedimentation is dominated by eastern Sahara dust input and Nile River runoff. These two windows were selected because they have comparable orbital configurations and bracket an important increase in East African C4 grasslands.  We conducted high-resolution (2.5 kyr sampling) multiproxy biomarker, H- and C-isotopic analyses of plant waxes and lignin phenols to document orbital-scale changes in hydrology, vegetation, and woody cover for these to intervals. Both intervals are dominated by large-amplitude, precession-scale (~20-kyr) changes in Northeast African vegetation and rainfall/runoff.  The _13Cwax values and lignin phenol composition record a variable but consistently C4 grass-dominated ecosystem for both intervals (50-80% C4). Precessional _Dwax cycles were approximately 20-30 in peak-to-peak amplitude, comparable to other _Dwax records of the early Holocene African humid period.  There were no significant differences in the means or variances of the _Dwax or _13Cwax data for the 3.05 Ma and 1.75 Ma intervals studied, suggesting that the paleohydrology and paleovegetation responses to precessional forcing were similar for these two periods. These results suggest that the eastern Sahara did not experience the significant increase in C4 vegetation that has been observed in East Africa over this time period. This observation is consistent with a proposed mechanism of East African climate change whereby regional precipitation was reduced in response to the emergence of modern zonal tropical SST gradients between 3-2 Ma.","Electron microprobe analyses of Apollo 14 high-Ti glasses from Lunar samples 14301, 14307, 14313, and 14049.","Electron microprobe analyses of Apollo 15 volcanic green glasses and yellow glasses contained within pyroclastic sample. 15426,72.","Electron microprobe analyses of Apollo 16 glasses from Lunar sample 60014","Electron microprobe analyses of Apollo 16 glasses from Lunar sample 64001","Electron microprobe analyses of Apollo 17 orange glasses contained within sample. 74220,128.","Electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS analyses of mantle xenocrysts from Lentiira-Kuhmo and Kuusamo area kimberlites.","Elemental OC, N and Stable C Isotope data from ODP167 (Cascadia), Sites 1019C and 1020B, measured to determine million-year scale influence of tectonics on organic carbon export and burial.","Elemental OC, N and Stable C Isotope for IODP Expedition 341 (Southern Alaska Margin)","Elemental OC, N, and Stable C Isotope for Hikurangi Margin (NZ), trough and turbidite sequences.

Offset middle Miocene rocks record a combined ~9 km of west-directed extension over the last ~14 Ma for the fault zones.  (U-Th)/He apatite cooling ages of samples from the central and southern Slate Range indicate that footwall cooling began around 14 Ma; we interpret this as the age of initiation of motion on the Slate Range detachment.  This timing is consistent with inferences made using stratigraphic and structural criteria.  Data from the northern Slate range show rapid fault slip began along the Searles Valley fault at ~4 Ma; data from the central and southern Slate Range can be interpreted to present cooling at 5 to 6 Ma.  This timing correlates to the results of nearby studies, suggesting a strain transition in the surrounding area between ~6-3 Ma.  Data collected are most consistent with a westward migration in the locus of transtensional deformation, and show that the initiation of that deformation commonly lags the timing predicted by plate reconstructions by a few million years.","Origin of glass and its relationships with phlogopite in mantle xenoliths from central Sardinia (Italy)","Overview of Tertiary tonalite plutons in Fiji.","Pb and Hf isotope ratios for samples from the Southeast Indian Ridge.","Pb and Hf isotopic analyses of basalt glass from the Lau Basin.","Petrology of ultramafic xenoliths in Cenozoic alkaline rocks of northern Madagascar (Nosy Be Archipelago)","Results of the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition.

This data was filtered and compiled to explore the magma characteristics of the respective arcs and to interpret their magmagenetic conditions such as sediment input, fluid-flux, and mantle and altered oceanic crustal components. To create the database, volcanic geochemical data for whole rock samples was downloaded from the EarthChem data portal (www.earthchem.org) (managed by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University). Four datasets are included in separate worksheets within the Excel workbook, which include separate major and trace element datasets for CentAm and IBM.  Each dataset contains metadata for each sample and major and trace element, isotope, and calculated normative mineral compositions.  The workbook also contains an explanation of methods and a list of data references.  Supplemental documents include a detailed explanation of the datasets and filter processes and an EndNote library text file.","The KN195-03 research cruise on board the R/V Knorr (Chief scientist Steven D'Hondt) took place in January-February 2009 and had as primary objective to test and refine quantitative models for the magnitude and geographic distribution of subseafloor biomass and organic-fueled subseafloor respiration.

Variables include the spatial distribution of the reactive mineral magnesite, orientation of the magnesite zone to the main flow direction, length scale, flow rates, and size contrast between magnesite and quartz grains. The columns with lengths varying from 5 to 22 cm were flushed with acidic solutions (pH 4.0) at flow velocities varying from 0.015 to 7.2 m/d. The largest rate difference was observed between a Mixed column containing uniformly distributed magnesite and a One-zone column containing magnesite in one cylindrical zone in the center of the column (flow-parallel One-zone column). Breakthrough data show that the zonation in the One-zone columns, especially when the grain sizes of magnesite are smaller than that of the quartz, limits magnesite dissolution by a factor of 1.5  4.0 compared to the Mixed column. The magnitude of the rate difference increases with increasing flow rates. Under low flow rate conditions, the pore fluids reach chemical equilibrium and reaction kinetics does not play an important role. For those conditions, the mineral distribution does not make a difference. Under high flow conditions, however, the effects of the mineral distribution are maximized because column-scale rates exhibit kinetic control due to low residence times. The rate differences between the Mixed and the flow-parallel One-zone cases are much larger than the 14% maximum difference observed between the Mixed column and the flow-perpendicular One-zone column. Thedata set identifies general principles that govern mineral dissolution rates in heterogeneous porous media. It will advance our models of the multi-component geochemical reactions in natural, heterogeneous porous media and will provide valuable insights on the laboratory-field rate discrepancy.","This data set contains geochemical analyses of hydrothermal gases from fumaroles, hot springs, and geothermal wells in the Central Southern Volcanic Zone (CSVZ) of Chile.","This data set contains geochemical and isotopic gas analyses of hydrothermal gases from fumaroles and hot springs from Everman volcano, Socorro Island, Mexico.","This data set contains helium and carbon isotope data collected from fumaroles, hot springs, water springs, mud-pots and geothermal wells from El Salvador and Honduras from 2002-2003.","This data set examines the largely unexplored role of illite spatial distribution patterns in dictating sorption of Cr(VI). Flow-through experiments were carried out at 0.6, 3.0 and 15.0 m/day using columns packed with the same illite and quartz mass however with different patterns and permeability contrasts. Column-scale sorption macrocapacity and macrorates were found to decrease with transport connectivity, a quantitative measure of heterogeneity characteristics. At 0.6 and 3.0 m/day, well-connected low permeability illite zones oriented in the flow-parallel direction leads to diffusion-controlled mass transport limitation to access sorption sites, leading to up to 1.4 order of magnitude lower macrocapacity and macrorates compared to those in minimally-connected columns with well-mixed illite and quartz. Insights gained here bridge gaps between laboratory and field application, advance predictive understanding of reactive transport processes in natural heterogeneous subsurface.","This data set includes bulk rock major and trace element compositions of granite, monzonite, monzodiorite and syenite samples from Annandagstoppane (Archean Grunehogna Craton) and from Hochlinfjellet (Maud Belt) in western Dronning Maud Land.","This data set reports H2O and Cl concentrations in basaltic lavas from the equatorial Mid-Atlantic ridge.

It presents volcanic gas data from 1953 through 1958 on two active Kamchatka volcanoes at different stages of their eruptive history. Volcanoes included are Shiveluch (both crater and fumaroles) and Klyuchevskoy's basalt crater named Belyanika. Fumarole gases, condensate vapors and volcanic gases were analyzed in the NaOH-free Basharina-method. Data set includes. acidic content, H2O content and other gases, plus major and trace elements analyses. Trace element analyses do not include actual values measured, they are simply stated as orders of magnitude, which are presented as percentage of the whole (i.e. 0.00n %). Much of the data was simply compared according to its temperatures and therefore dates were omitted from some samples.","This is a summary of volcanic fumarole gas data collected from 1963 through 1970 from Avachinsky volcano, Russia. Fumarole gases were collected from a Sulfur ridge, and fumaroles at the 'bottom crater' of Avachinsky volcano.

The data file gives a summary of the major and trace element composition of sulfide and silicate liquids determined by EMP and Laser-Ablation ICPMS, and a data table of the sulfide/silicate element partitioning coefficients.","We present here annotated MATLAB scripts (and specific guidelines for their use) for Q-mode factor analysis, a constrained least squares multiple linear regression technique, and a total inversion protocol, that are based on the well-known approaches taken by Dymond (1981), Leinen and Pisias (1984), Kyte et al. (1993), and their predecessors. Although these techniques have been used by investigators for the past decades, their application has been neither consistent nor transparent, as their code has remained in-house or in formats not commonly used by many of today's researchers (e.g., FORTRAN). In addition to providing the annotated scripts and instructions for use, we include a sample data set for the user to test their own manipulation of the scripts.","We present version 2 of a database for Central American volcanic rocks and related components. The Rutgers University Central American Geochemical data (RU_CAGeochem) includes the active volcanoes related to the Cocos-Caribbean convergent plate boundary that extends from Guatemala to Costa Rica in Central America. The RU prefix signifies that the data and/or samples are primarily from the long-term Central American research project started at Dartmouth College in 1970 and continued at Rutgers University between 1974 to the present. The database is decidedly uneven because of the impressive improvement of analytical techniques during the period of sample and data production. Further complications arise because most of the sampling and analysis were part of the educational process for many different undergraduate and graduate students using different types of instruments. This note presents, as a reasonably coherent whole, geochemical data and metadata for about 1325 samples collected by at least 40 students and colleagues. Many new Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios are included here but most of the new data are metadata that provide greatly improved descriptions of the locations and status of the samples as well as estimates of data quality.

This will increase knowledge of ostracods and environmental data from high-altitude lakes and waterbodies."],"y":[0.5]}},"id":"623ad366-3e1a-485f-b7e6-40163fb94168","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"623ad366-3e1a-485f-b7e6-40163fb94168","type":"ColumnDataSource"},"glyph":{"id":"c2d3e0b4-b11f-4008-b4c5-19a9e9d44d98","type":"Rect"},"hover_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":null,"selection_glyph":null},"id":"092c3e00-311f-4142-a6d2-478a074d45fe","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"field":"fill_alpha"},"fill_color":{"field":"color"},"height":{"field":"height","units":"data"},"line_color":{"field":"line_color"},"width":{"field":"width","units":"data"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"a015ab7f-5979-4057-9165-80e72325673d","type":"Rect"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"field":"fill_alpha"},"fill_color":{"field":"color"},"height":{"field":"height","units":"data"},"line_color":{"field":"line_color"},"width":{"field":"width","units":"data"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"948a2595-40a6-4fb1-8fbe-62292751108b","type":"Rect"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"field":"fill_alpha"},"fill_color":{"field":"color"},"height":{"field":"height","units":"data"},"line_color":{"field":"line_color"},"width":{"field":"width","units":"data"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"a186de80-e344-4afc-8edc-6ca17d94203b","type":"Rect"},{"attributes":{"callback":null,"column_names":["x","y","width","height","color","fill_alpha","line_color","line_alpha","label"],"data":{"Content":["Major, Trace Element, and Isotope Data for Rumble V Ridge Lavas and Southern Kermadec Subducting Sediments, and other tables from Todd et al., 2010.
